            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Welcome to JISMUN'25, an exciting opportunity to be part of a global simulation where students step into the shoes of diplomats and take on international issues. Through the Model United Nations (MUN) experience, delegates will hone their skills in negotiation, public speaking, diplomacy, and critical thinking, which are invaluable for both academic and personal growth. Whether you're an experienced MUN participant or a first-timer, JISMUN'25 promises to offer an unforgettable learning experience. We bring together like-minded students who share a passion for global issues, diplomacy, and making a meaningful impact on the world. This event is set to feature a range of committees covering a variety of contemporary global challenges, alongside workshops to further develop the delegates' understanding of the United Nations and its workings.</p>
